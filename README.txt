This is a Jupyter Notebook that shows how many hours need to be worked monthly in order to pay rent at the 
national minimum wage($7.25) and the average of all state minimum wages($9.51).  This does include Washington 
D.C. and Puerto Rico.  This does not account for income tax.

The data used is the csv that can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/jweinflash/us-rent-by-county/data or 
is available on this github page labeled rent_data.csv

The only requirement to visualize this data is to install Anaconda; which can be installed at 
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

The first table is the csv file imported with no alterations(Out[3]).  The second table shows each state's
abbreviation, mean rent per month, monthly hours worked at national minimum, and monthly hours worked at average 
minimum(Out[7]).    The first bar graph is a representation of mean monthly rent in descending order(Out[8]).  
Lastly the second bar graph shows a comparison of the number of hours worked monthy at both the national minimum
and the average minimum wages in descending order(Out[9]).

In order to see all of this you must run visualize.ipynb with Jupyter Notebook.  Follow the steps and compile the
notebook.  The comments on each cell will give a description of what is happening along with any unusual changes
that had to be made.

Enjoy!
